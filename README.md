# Traffic-Signal-Recognition-System-using-Yolov5-and-OAK-1-PoE
I developed a traffic sign recognition system using YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and the OAK-1 camera for image acquisition. My project detects signs such as speed limits, stop signs, and traffic lights, making it suitable for driver assistance applications.
